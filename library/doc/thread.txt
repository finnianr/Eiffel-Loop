**Work Distribution**

Classes [$source EL_PROCEDURE_DISTRIBUTER] and [$source EL_FUNCTION_DISTRIBUTER]
offer a convenient way to distribute the work of executing routines using a specific number of cores.
See routine `read_source_files' in class [$source EIFFEL_CONFIGURATION_FILE] for an example.

**Producer-Consumer Framework**

A generic producer-consumer thread communication framework where a producing thread places products onto a queue for consumption by a consumer thread.

''Features''

* Implementation of a single consumer thread consuming the products of a single worker thread.
* Implementation of multiple consumer threads consuming the products of a single worker thread.
* Vision2 extension allowing products of a thread to be consumed by the main GUI application thread.
* Specialized consumer-producer thread classes for agent action consuming.

**Specialized Threads**

The library includes many thread classes inheriting from [$source EL_IDENTIFIED_THREAD_I] that perform specialized tasks.

''Examples''

* Intermittently repeat an action with a specified sleep interval until signaled to stop.
* Continuously repeat an action until signaled to stop.
* Continuously repeat an action until receiving a signal to suspend or exit. Remains suspended unless signaled to resume or exit.

**Other Features**

* A Vision2 extension framework for building proxy interfaces to GUI components that are callable from non-GUI threads. Allows non-GUI threads to asynchronously call routines that call Vision2 routines.
* Intermittent timed event framework
* Container cell class for numeric types shared across threads. Features thread safe increment, decrement, add and subtract operations.
* Thread safe queue and stack container classes.
