**General Features**

* Command templates are based on the powerful [./library/evolicity.html Evolicity text substitution library].

* Support for command output capture, and error output capture.

* Automatic escaping of path arguments conforming to ${EL_PATH}, namely ${EL_FILE_PATH} and ${EL_DIR_PATH}. All Windows paths are automatically put in quotes. Unix paths are automatically escaped with \ for reserved characters. This has some advantages over putting them in quotes.

* Designed for cross platform use, with special features for post-capture processing of output lines so they are consistent across platforms. See classes ${EL_FIND_DIRECTORIES_COMMAND_I} and ${EL_FIND_FILES_COMMAND_I} as an example. Here the Unix `find' command and the Windows `dir' command are made to appear exactly the same for specific tasks.

* Support for making "convenience wrappers" without any need to create a new class. These are classes: ${EL_OS_COMMAND} and ${EL_CAPTURED_OS_COMMAND}.

* Has factory class ${EL_OS_ROUTINES_IMP} (accessible via ${EL_MODULE_OS}) which contains factory functions for common OS system commands.

**Information Commands**

These are "out of the box" command for obtaining system information.

* Unix command to parse output of nm-tool to get MAC address of ethernet devices

* Unix command to obtain CPU name

**Future Development**

Make a platform independent interface for listing symbolic link targets in a directory.
