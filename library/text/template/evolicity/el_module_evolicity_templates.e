	description: "[
		Provides global access to the Evolicity template substitution engine.

		The templating substitution language was named "Evolicity" as a portmanteau of "Evolve" and "Felicity" 
		which is also a partial anagram of "Velocity" the Apache project which inspired it. 
		It also bows to an established tradition of naming Eiffel orientated projects starting with the letter 'E'.
