	description: "[
		A state machine for processing lines from a line source, using a line processing procedure
		defined by the attribute:
		
			state: PROCEDURE [ZSTRING]
			
		The line processing state can be changed by assigning a new procedure to `state'.
		Line processing stops either when `state' is assigned the procedure `final' or the last line
		in the line source is reached.
