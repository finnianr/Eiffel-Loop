			AES Encryption and Hashing

			**Encryption**

			An easy interface to basic AES encryption with extensions to Colin LeMahieu's
			[https://github.com/EiffelSoftware/EiffelStudio/tree/master/Src/contrib/library/text/encryption/eel AES
			encryption library]. Includes a class for reading and writing encrypted files using
			[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard AES]
			cipher [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation block chains].

			**Hashing**

			Routines for creating SHA-256 and MD5 hashes as well as UUID system time hashes.
