	description: "[
		Fixes an Eiffel object in memory so that it can be the target of callbacks from a
		C routine. The garbage collector is prevented from moving it during collect cycles.
	]"
	instructions: "[
		Use this class by making a call to the `new_callback' function in a descendant of class
		${EL_C_CALLABLE}.
	]"
