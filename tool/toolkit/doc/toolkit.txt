A "Swiss-army knife" of useful command line tools. Some of the most useful ones are listed here with command line options:

`-crypto': [$source CRYPTO_APP]

Menu driven shell of useful cryptographic operations.

`-pyxis_to_xml': [$source PYXIS_TO_XML_APP]

Converts Pyxis format to XML with special support for Eiffel configuration files in Pyxis format (extension `pecf'). The attribute `configuration_ns' can be used as convenient shorthand for the ECF schema configuration information.

`-export_www': [$source THUNDERBIRD_WWW_EXPORTER_APP]

Exports emails from selected Thunderbird email folders as HTML bodies (extension: `body'). As the name implies, only the body of the HTML is preserved. A matching folder structure is also created. This is useful for HTML content managers.

`-compile_translations': [$source PYXIS_TRANSLATION_TREE_COMPILER_APP]

Compiles tree of Pyxis translation files into multiple locale files named `locale.x' where `x' is a 2 letter country code. Does nothing if source files are all older than locale files. See class [$source EL_LOCALE_I].
