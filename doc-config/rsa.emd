Extends Colin LeMahieu's arbitrary precision integer library to conform to some RSA standards. The most important is the ability
to read key-pairs conforming to the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509#Sample_X.509_certificates X509 PKCS1 standard]. The top level class to access these facilities is [$source EL_MODULE_X509_COMMAND].

The private key reader however uses a non-standard encryption scheme. It assumes the file is encrypted using the Eiffel-Loop
utility contained in `el_toolkit'. See class [$source CRYPTO_APP] for details.
