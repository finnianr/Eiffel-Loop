# Eiffel-Loop as it was on the xxx 2016

Intermediate releases: 1.4.2a

## BASE library
* Added class `EL_COLON_FIELD_ROUTINES` accessible through class `EL_MODULE_COLON_FIELD`. Used to parse colon delimited fields in file line.

## OS-COMMAND library
* Removed `is_asynchronous' from `EL_OS_COMMAND_I' because it was a bad idea that lead to problems.
